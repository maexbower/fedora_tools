These two scripts were created to limit the maximum CPU frequency to keep my notebook quiet. 

There are two scripts, one for set and one for unset the frequency limit. You have to set the limited and maximum frequency according to your own CPU specification.

The .desktop files need to have the shell scripts be stored under /usr/local/bin.

Place .desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications/ or in /usr/share/applications/

Place .policy files in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/
